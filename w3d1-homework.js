EXTRA CHALLENGE: Can you find the needle in the haystack?
Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of items but containing one item, "needle".
After your function finds the needle, it should return a message (as a string) that says:
"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle.

Example(Input --> Output)
["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] => "found the needle at position 5"
